# SEABEARS

For this project, we are comparing the genome assembly of _Hypsibius dujardini_ (tardigrade, aka sea bears) between two different assembling programs through conda. We are following a previous study (SOURCE) which used spades as the de novo genome assembler. The assembler we will be comparing to spades is Canu. Canu is a de novo genome assembler most often used for ______.

INSTALLING: Canu de novo genome assembler ##
conda install -c bioconda canu

INSTALLING: SPAdes de novo genome assembler ##
conda install -c bioconda spades
